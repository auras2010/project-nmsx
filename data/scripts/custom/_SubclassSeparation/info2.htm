Subclass Separatot:<br>
There is more important information that you must be aware of, 
before starting the subclass separation process. 
I will explain them in details, here are the thins that <font color="LEVEL">won't </font><br>
be kept in your new character (remind that these information are specifically of your subclass):<br>
* Quest information<br>
* Skills (cooldowns will be reseted as if they were never used.)<br>
* Shortcuts<br>
* Macroses<br>
<br>
The following will be done after the process has started:<br>

* Your new character will have its appearance settings all on 'A'.<br>
* All subclass skills will be transfered to the new character.<br>
* <font color="LEVEL">Level</font>, <font color="LEVEL">exp</font>, <font color="LEVEL">sp.</font> <br>
and <font color="LEVEL">class</font> will be transfered to the new character.<br>
* The location where the new character is will be mantained.<br>
* All items on the new character will be deleted, this includes: warehouse, clan warehouse, freight. (if any)<br>
