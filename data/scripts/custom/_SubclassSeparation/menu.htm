Subclass Separator:<br>
This is a very special service and it is irreversible.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Subclass Separation</font> allows you to split a
subclass into a new character. That can be done within some specific
conditions. There is no fee on this process, however, is only up to
you to decide doing it or not.
