<html><body>Kratei's Cube Entrance Manager:<br>
Kratei's Cube allows <font color="LEVEL">25 warriors who are level 70 and above to compete for 20 minutes</font> to see who is the strongest. Warriors advance through the rooms of the Cube, encountering hordes of monsters as they go. Defeat as many monsters and other warriors as possible within the time limit; whoever defeats the most wins.<br>
If you are killed, you can teleport back to the Match Manager. If the match hasn't ended, you may re-enter. <font color="LEVEL">Doing so will decrease your experience score.</font><br>
The 20-minute competitions start exactly on each hour and half-hour, and you can normally register up until 3 minutes before they begin.<br>
