To participate in the event, you must swim to Fantasy Isle...<br>
Actually, that's not true. Just click on the <font color="LEVEL">Go to Fantasy Isle</font> link below and you'll be sent directly there. You can return to the village you came from free of charge. <br1>
For a nominal fee, you can obtain a Rabbit Transformation Scroll from any Event Manager. <font color="LEVEL">This is an essential component for hunting on Fantasy Isle.</font> This item will transform you into a cute and furry rabbit.  And it is only within this form that you can detect the hidden treasure boxes spread throughout the island. Just remember that you can only obtain this special transformation scroll during the event period every 12 hours (per account).<br>
