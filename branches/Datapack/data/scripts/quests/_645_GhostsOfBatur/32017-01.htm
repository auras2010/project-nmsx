		You have the look of an experienced adventurer, maybe you can help us. There are many angry spirits wandering around here their traces are obvious. We desperately need help to prevent them from going to the Immortal Plateu. Will you help us, o brave one?<br>
		We can help the Spiteful Souls in the<font color="LEVEL"> Crypts of Disgrace</font> to become "saved" before they travel elsewhere. When you defeat the Spiteful Souls, you will see some<font color="LEVEL"> Cursed Grave Accessories</font> which they used to manifest their physical power. Please these accessories them and bring them to me.<br>
		By my current estimate, I need about<font color="LEVEL"> 500</font> of them. If you get me that many, I think I can do the rest.<br>
