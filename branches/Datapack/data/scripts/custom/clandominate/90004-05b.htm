<html><body>Magnus The Unicorn:<br>
As I promised here is the details of the second test:<br>
- from 18:00 till 19:00 your clan every lvl76+ members will be teleported to a special dungeon.<br>
- your clan is marked with Blue aura this means that your clan is part of the Blue Team. Enemy team will be marked with Red aura.<br>
- 3 special Merrow The Unicorn will be in the Dungeon. They will sometime give 1 point to the team who have more live members next to him but I warn you that there is a minimal limit for the team to get the score.<br>
- after the 1 hours time we will see which team will have more points.<br>
